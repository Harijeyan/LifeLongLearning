5 Calculations are needed to create your current vs pervious year difference in sales.

Current Year - Bring back your current year:
{MAX(YEAR([Order Date]))}

Prior Year - Now that you have your current year, all you need to do is minus your current year by 1:
[Current Year]-1

CY Sales - An IF statement is required to bring back your current year sales:
IF [Current Year]= YEAR([Order Date]) THEN [Sales] END

PY Sales - Likewise for your previous year's sales:
IF [Prior Year]= YEAR([Order Date]) THEN [Sales] END

CY vs PY - For your final calculation to find the difference in sales between the current and prior year, a simple subtraction then division is needed:
(SUM([CY Sales])- SUM([PY Sales])) / SUM([PY Sales])
